          "Carly has been into fitness and health for as long as she could walk. Early on in she began to play sports in her little town in Michigan, eventually joining the volleyball and softball teams at the middle school and high school level.",
          "Though Carly did not play at the collegiate level, she did continue with her focus on health and fitness at the University of Tampa, where she graduated with a B.S. in Athletic Training. After graduating in 2013, she became a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) through NSCA. Carly has since continued her exploration of her favorite types of exercises and techniques which led her to finding a passion with kettlebell training.",
          "Coming to realize the benefits of kettlebell training was just the beginning. Carly earned her Russian Kettlebell Challenge certification as well as her Functional Movement Systems certification prior to teaching at Kettle POP, where she now teaches Kettlebell and Form & Function classes and is available for One-on-One sessions."
